# Comments

I tried matching the styling as closely as possible to the Figma design. I also added a loading spinner for the API call.

- One of my first priorities was creating _typing_ for the applications. (However, I set the dates to be strings to avoid messing with the formatting until later formatting with my utility function.)
- I would have typically used _Tailwind_, but you already had a nice setup with all the CSS files.
- The code for the _loading spinner_ is based off one of these: https://cssloaders.github.io/

Thanks for opportunity!
